### Objective

Your assignment is to implement a URL shortening service using Ruby. You can use any framework you want (or no framework at all, it is up to you).

### Brief

ShortLink is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as https://codesubmit.io/library/react and it returns a short URL such as http://short.est/GeAi9K.

### Tasks

-   Implement assignment using:
    -   Language: **Ruby**
    -   Two endpoints are required
        -   /encode - Encodes a URL to a shortened URL
        -   /decode - Decodes a shortened URL to its original URL.
    -   Both endpoints should return JSON
-   There is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to make sure that a URL can be encoded to a short URL and the short URL can be decoded to the original URL.
- Your application needs to be able to decode previously encoded URLs after a restart.
-   Provide detailed instructions on how to run your assignment in a separate markdown file.
-   Provide tests for both endpoints (and any other tests you may want to write).
-  You need to think through potential attack vectors on the application, and document them in the README.
-  You need to think through how your implementation may scale up, and document your approach in the README. **You do not need to build a scalable service for this challenge but you need to document how you would approach building a scalable version of it.**

### Evaluation Criteria

-   **Ruby** best practices
-   API implemented featuring a /encode and /decode endpoint
-   Completeness: did you complete the features? Are all the tests running?
-   Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
-   Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?
-   Security: have you thought through potential issues and mitigated or documented them?
-   Scalability: what scalability issues do you foresee in your implementation and how do you plan to work around those issues?
